# remove-github-reactions

A userscript to remove reactions to comments in github issues and pull requests.
I dislike the comment reactions so I decided to remove them.

### Install

#### Firefox

Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/), then **[click here to install remove-github-reactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nokaa/remove-github-reactions/master/remove-github-reactions.user.js)**

#### Chromium

Install Violentmonkey ([Opera store](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) / [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violent-monkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag)) or [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), then **[click here to install remove-github-reactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nokaa/remove-github-reactions/master/remove-github-reactions.user.js)**.

#### Safari

Install [JS Blocker](http://jsblocker.toggleable.com/), then **[click here to install remove-github-reactions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nokaa/remove-github-reactions/master/remove-github-reactions.user.js)**. [Tampermonkey for Safari](http://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari) may also work, but I have yet to test it.
